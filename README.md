# Usage

Download all files, making sure to preserve the directory structure.

Load a US Ages or Seasons ROM in Bizhawk in the Gambatta core, and run the
"Info.lua". (Yeah it needs to be renamed.)

# Controls

All controls are done with the numpad to avoid conflicts with Bizhawk
keybindings.

Press a numpad key to activate a function. Press numpad up/down/pgup/pgdown to
navigate options. Press numpad enter to select something. Press escape to exit
a menu.
